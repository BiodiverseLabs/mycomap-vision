# MycoMap Vision plan

Goal: a public fungal identifier that uses every photo of a record, is trained
only on DNA-validated MycoMap records, and gives a prediction and confidence at
every rank, with advice on how to improve an ID. It runs as its own platform;
mycomap.org links to it and calls its API when needed.

Decisions to date are recorded in the project memory and CLAUDE.md. This file is
the working plan; update it as phases land.

## Phase 0: data and a first honest number (in progress)

- [x] Export green records from mycomap.org (read-only). 164,201 records,
      159,353 in North America, 146 label conflicts held out.
- [x] iNat metadata: 155,858 observations, 593,224 photos with owner and license
      (16% all rights reserved, 1,251 photographers to ask).
- [ ] Download large (1024 px) photos straight into S3 (`mv aws-launch-downloader`,
      ~250 GB, ~2 days for the capped all-rights-reserved part). Waiting on the
      one-time AWS setup in `deploy/aws/README.md`.
- [x] Embedding pipeline (`mv embed`), any timm or open_clip backbone; tried so far: BioCLIP 2
      (~95 photos/s on the laptop 4070), DINOv2-B (~64/s), DINOv2-L at 518 px (~13/s).
- [x] Evaluation harness (`mv compare`): identify the newest 28 days of green
      records from older ones, by nearest DNA-verified specimen; top-1/top-5 at
      family, genus, species, split by reference count (novel, 1, 2, 3-5, 6-30, 31+);
      all photos vs first photo only.
- [ ] iNat computer-vision baseline on the same test records (`mv inat-baseline`:
      best score across a record's photos, photo-only and with iNat's location
      model; needs a 24-hour iNat token).
- [ ] First comparison report.
- [x] Web app and API (`mv serve`) with Identify, Models (scoreboard), Data, How it works;
      confidence calibrated per rank from each model's latest comparison.

## Models: modular, side by side, on a scoreboard

A "model" here is a **backbone** (frozen image model -> vector per photo) plus a
**method** (how photo vectors become species scores). Both are swappable:

- Backbones: `models.py`. Any timm or open_clip model works by spec with no code
  (`mv embed --backbone timm:<name>`); favourites get a short alias. Other
  sources (Hugging Face transformers, ONNX, an API) are one loader class each.
- Methods: `evaluate.METHODS`. Now `nearest` (best-matching DNA-verified
  specimen) and `species-mean` (species average vector); trained heads,
  multi-photo attention and the range prior plug in the same way.
- `mv compare --backbones a,b,c --methods nearest,species-mean` scores every
  pair on exactly the same test and reference photos (only photos every backbone
  has embedded), and saves each run to the scoreboard (`eval_runs` in the
  manifest, with the record-set hash and code version). `mv scoreboard` lists
  them; the frontend shows them and runs models side by side on your photos.

Screening policy: try many cheaply, fine-tune few. Frozen screening costs one
embedding pass over a fixed screening set (minutes to an hour on the laptop
GPU) and seconds to score, so 10-15 candidates is fine. Candidates to screen
(aliases in `mv models`): BioCLIP 2, DINOv2 B/L (G too if it fits), DINOv3 B/L
(in timm; Meta's DINOv3 licence needs a read before any public release), SigLIP 2
L/384 (open_clip), EVA-02 L/448, ConvNeXt V2 L as a non-transformer contrast,
plus iNat's own model as an external baseline on the same test records. (timm
has no iNat-trained checkpoints, so that idea is dropped.) The best 2-3 go on
to fine-tuning in phase 1.

## Frontend (started 2026-09-28, grows with every phase)

A web app to try the identifier as it develops. It follows mycomap.org's design
so moving between the two sites feels like one site: the same colour tokens
(myco green and brown), sticky white header with the MycoMap logo, grey nav
links that turn green, brown gradient footer, shadcn "new-york" components and
system/Inter type. Species link to `mycomap.org/species/<name>`, records to iNat.

- `web/`: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind (the .org stack), talking to
- `mycomap_vision/api.py`: FastAPI over the manifest and embeddings.

Pages:
- **Identify**: upload several photos (plus optional place and date), get the
  rank ladder (family, genus, species) with confidence, the closest
  DNA-verified specimens with their photos, and hints on how to improve the ID.
- **Data**: records, photos, licenses, download and embedding progress, names by
  number of DNA-verified records.
- **Models**: the scoreboard; each comparison by rank and by reference count.
- Identify can run two or more models side by side on the same photos.
- **How it works**: plain-language method and its limits.

Later: photo view tags (cap, underside, stem, habitat) with "add an underside
photo" hints, map for location, account-free sharing of a result, and the
production deploy at `vision.mycomap.org` on its own Lightsail box.

## Phase 1: a better identifier

- Photo view tagging: a cheap LLM labels a seed set, a small head on the
  embeddings does the rest.
- Learned multi-photo weighting (attention over photo embeddings with view tags).
- Fine-tune the best backbone on well-sampled species (metric learning), keep
  nearest-specimen lookup for the long tail (43% of names have one record).
- Hierarchical, calibrated confidence per rank (so 80% means right 80% of the time).
- Crops of the fruiting body from the large photos.

## Phase 2: range and season

- Per-taxon range and phenology from DNA records, corrected for DNA sampling
  effort (all DNA records as the background). Shared with mycomap.org/conservation.
- A separate, capped prior multiplied into the photo score; both shown.

## Training on an AWS GPU instance (Steve, 2026-09-28)

Embedding the full photo set and training the heads move off the laptop to a GPU
instance started on demand, like the downloader: `mv aws-launch-trainer` starts
it, it reads the large photos straight from S3, embeds them with the chosen
backbones, trains and compares every method, writes embeddings, trained weights
and the scoreboard back to S3, and shuts itself down (with a backstop). The
laptop pulls the results with a merge, as for downloads. The linear classifier
already trains on a CUDA GPU when one is present.

Setup needed first (Steve):
- A GPU quota: AWS console -> Service Quotas -> Amazon EC2 -> "Running On-Demand
  G and VT instances" (and "All G and VT Spot Instance Requests" for spot), e.g.
  8 vCPUs in us-east-2. New accounts often start at 0.
- The ops policy gains read access to the Deep Learning AMI's public parameter
  (/aws/service/deeplearning/ami/...), and spot requests if we use spot.
- Budget alarm in place (a g5/g6.xlarge is roughly a dollar an hour on demand,
  less on spot; one full embedding pass should take a few hours).

Build after the full photo set is in S3.

## Phase 3: the platform

- Own Lightsail instance (`vision.mycomap.org`), photos and models in S3, weekly
  job on a spot GPU: new green records → score them first (the weekly test),
  then add them to the reference set and retrain the small heads.
- Prospective test on arrival (Steve, 2026-09-28): every new batch is scored by
  every model, iNat's computer vision included (`mv inat-baseline`), *before*
  its DNA barcode result exists; when the barcodes come back, the predictions are
  validated instantly. Nothing can have seen the answer, so it is the fairest
  test of all, and it covers provisional names, which iNat has begun to carry.
- Model registry with an evaluation report per release; a release goes live only
  if it did not get worse.
- API for mycomap.org (FungAI, Validate Records, record pages).
